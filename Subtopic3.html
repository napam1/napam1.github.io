 style="font-family: Century Schoolbook;">This site describes how the introduction of closed captioning revolutionized life for Deaf individuals by allowing them to access news broadcasts, conferences, and movies in a much simpler way. This site shows many images from protests demanding captions on CBS, to images from the Gallaudet University Archives showing how they had to use computers to type what was being said in conferences in real-time. The "Chip Bill" in Deaf history refers to the Television Decoder Circuitry Act of 1993, which mandated that all new televisions sold in the United States with screens 13 inches or larger must have built-in closed captioning technology.

      <td style="vertical-align: top; font-family: Century Schoolbook;"><big><small>This site contains a timeline of the development of closed captioning and how it evolved. Includes years and a description of what that year served to the Deaf community. It starts with the 1970s, when the National Bureau of Standards and ABC first experimented with digitally encoding time information into television signals. It goes on to describe how captions were introduced and how other companies and broadcasts were being used during its early experimental stages in the 70s and 80s, until the most recent years in the 2000s, when it became a requirement by law for televisions to include a decoder chip.
