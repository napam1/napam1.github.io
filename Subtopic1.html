 style="font-family: Century Schoolbook;">This site contains a timeline of the beginnings of technology for the Deaf and Hard-of-Hearing communities. Includes years and a brief description of communication technology for the Deaf and its advances. Starts with the year 1964 and the invention of the teletypewriter, the first device that would bridge the gap between communities. Then follows the years 1980 and 1990 where teletypewriters were available to be bought by the public and the use of pagers and how it further broke down communication barriers. It also describes how in 2000, Video Relay Services made a rise and had a tremendous impact on how the Deaf could have much more access in healthcare, education, and social interactions.

      <td style="vertical-align: top; font-family: Century Schoolbook;"><big><small>This site also is a timeline of the evolution technology for the Deaf and Hard-of-Hearing communities. It includes information from 1800 with the creation of Eartrumpets, established by Frederick C. Rein in London is an instrument used to amplify sound for the partially deaf and was used as hearing aids. These were increasingly common but were later changed to be smaller due to its bulkyness and size. This site differs from the first one because it includes older technologies and provides links to sources used. For example, unlike the first site, it features a violet ray device used for ultraviolet therapy, thought to be beneficial in destroying bacterial growth and reducing any growth in the ear canal.
